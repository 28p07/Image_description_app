# Image Description App

# Image Description App

This is a web application built with Flask and TensorFlow that allows users to upload an image and get a description of the image based on the predictions of a pre-trained InceptionV3 model from TensorFlow Hub.

## Features
- Upload an image to the app.
- Get a description of the image based on its content (e.g., dog, cat, car).
- Built using Flask for the backend and TensorFlow for image classification.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, TensorFlow Hub
- **Image Processing**: Pillow (PIL)
- **Model**: Pre-trained InceptionV3 model from TensorFlow Hub
- **Hosting**: Local server (development)

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-description-app.git
    cd image-description-app
    ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the `imagenet-classes.txt` file that contains the class labels for InceptionV3. You can find it here: [imagenet-classes.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anishathalye/imagenet-simple-labels/master/imagenet-simple-labels.json). Save it in the project directory.

4. Set up your environment (optional but recommended):
   
   Create a `.env` file with the following variables (if necessary):
   ```bash
   FLASK_APP=app.py
   FLASK_ENV=development
Start the Flask server:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The application will be running locally at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

App Usage
Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser.
Upload an image using the "Upload an Image" button.
The app will process the image and display a description of the image (e.g., "A dog", "A cat").
File Structure

Copy code

Dependencies
The app requires the following Python libraries:

Flask
TensorFlow
Pillow (PIL)
TensorFlow Hub
NumPy
To install all dependencies, use the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file should look like this:
Flask
tensorflow
tensorflow-hub
Pillow
Troubleshooting
Error: No file uploaded
Ensure the file is correctly selected before submitting the form.

Error: Failed to process the image
Check if the image is in a valid format (JPEG, PNG, etc.) and has dimensions that are compatible with the model (299x299 pixels).

Model Prediction Error
If there is an issue with TensorFlow or the model, ensure that your environment has the required dependencies and TensorFlow is properly installed.


### Instructions for Running the App
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Download the `imagenet-classes.txt` file and save it in the project directory.
3. Run the Flask app using `python app.py`.
4. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
5. Upload an image to get a description.
